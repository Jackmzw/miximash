# miximash: Mixtures of Independent Components in Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage

This R package implements statistical methods that generalize the
[Cormotif model](https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.Cormotif) for
jointly analyzing differential gene expression in multiple studies or
under multiple experimental conditions (e.g., measured in different
cell types). Model fitting procedures are implemented using
expectation maximization (EM).
