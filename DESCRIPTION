Description: Statistical methods that generalize the Cormotif model
    (Y. Wei, T. Tenzen & H. Ji, 2015,
    <DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxu038>) for jointly analyzing
    differential gene expression in multiple studies or under multiple
    experimental conditions (e.g., measured in different cell types).
    Model fitting procedures are implemented using expectation
    maximization (EM).
